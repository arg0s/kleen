#Kleen

Kleen is a lightweight blog theme for Pelican built with focus on readability. For an example of the theme in actions, visit [www.arg0s.in](http://www.arg0s.in)


## Approach

* Inspired by popular sites like Medium, Readability & Pocket.
* Serif everywhere.
* Responsive design.
* Clean & crisp.

## Compass

The `main.css` file is generated from the `compass/src/main.scss` sass file, using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Note: This is adapated from the good work of the [mnmlist theme](http://mnmlist.com/theme) adapted for Pelican with some extra goodness tossed in to promote greater readability.
